# Rules

## Submissions

Submissions must follow the guidelines of the specific problem in order to count. In general, the guidelines will cover things like input (file or stdin), output (file or stdout), and restrictions regarding solution types if applicable (e.g. whether using interpreter arguments to import libraries instead of doing so from within the file is allowed).

## Tooling/Libraries

Any language specific libraries are allowed. This can help familiarize you with the language! However, no external files are to be downloaded and imported. If it's not a library supported by the language's package manager (e.g. [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/), [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/), or [gem](https://rubygems.org/)), it cannot be used.

## Collaboration

Collaboration with classmates is allowed, encouraged even. If you receive help on 40% or more of your solution from an individual, submit as a group. Feel free to ask other people online or elsewhere for help on certain language related questions, but do not seek help on the problem itself. If you find a solution for the problem online, do not submit that solution. Feel free to learn from it or transcribe it into a different language, but do not submit that copy.

## Scoring

The lowest character count wins. Perhaps a per-language leaderboard will be created eventually, but only character count is what will be used for now. There will be two categories: best score in one language and best average score across five languages.
