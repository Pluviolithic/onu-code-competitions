# Example Problem
Solve [this problem from CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/unary) in as few characters as possible.

## The Goal
- Binary with 0 and 1 is good, but binary with only 0, or almost, is even better!
- Write a program that takes an incoming message as input and displays as output the message encoded using this method.

## Rules
- Here is the encoding principle:
  - The input message consists of ASCII characters (7-bit)
  - The encoded output message consists of blocks of `0`
  - A block is separated from another block by a space
  - Two consecutive blocks are used to produce a series of same value bits (only `1` or `0` values):
    - First block: it is always `0` or `00`. If it is `0`, then the series contains `1`, if not, it contains `0`
    - Second block: the number of `0` in this block is the number of bits in the series

## Examples
### Example 1
- Letâ€™s take a simple example with a message which consists of only one character: Capital C. C in binary is represented as 1000011, so with this method, this gives:
  - `0 0` (the first series consists of only a single `1`)
  - `00 0000` (the second series consists of four `0`s)
  - `0 00` (the third consists of two `1`s)
- So C is coded as: `0 0 00 0000 0 00`

### Example 2
- Say we want to encode the message CC (i.e. the 14 bits `10000111000011`) :
  - `0 0` (one single `1`)
  - `00 0000` (four `0`)
  - `0 000` (three `1`)
  - `00 0000` (four `0`)
  - `0 00` (two `1`)
- So CC is encoded as: `0 0 00 0000 0 000 00 0000 0 00`
