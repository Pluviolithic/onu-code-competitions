## Code Golf

This repository will host weekly code golf problems for interested students to participate in. Each problem will be handpicked ensure sufficient complexity and interest. The goal of code golf is simple: produce code to solve a problem that uses the absolute minimum number of characters.

The goals of this are manifold. First, it encourages students to branch into many different languages and syntax styles. Second, it developes a solid problem-solving mindset that can be extrapolated to any pursuit. Finally, it encourages rapid acquisition of specific knowledge in an area to solve a problem (e.g. unique prime number algorithms to find/list patterns).

See the [rules](/CodeGolf/RULES.md) for details.
